Exercise 1.2: Translate the following expression into prefix
form:
5 + 4 + (2 − (3 − (6 + 4/5 )))
----------------------------------
     3(6 − 2)(2 − 7)

Result:
(/
(+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6(/ 4 5)))))
(* 3 (- 6 2)(- 2 7)))



Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers
as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two
larger numbers.
Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows
for combinations whose operators are compound expres-
sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine
whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-
order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the
following two procedures:
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
(if (= x 0) 0 y))
en he evaluates the expression
(test 0 (p))
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that
uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he
observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evalu-
ation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation
27rule for the special form if is the same whether the in-
terpreter is using normal or applicative order: e predi-
cate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines
whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative ex-
pression.)
