; Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers
; as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two
; larger numbers.

( define (sqsum a b) ( + ( * a a)(* b b)))
( define ( >= x y) (or (> x y) (= x y)))
( define ( <= x y) (or (> y x) (= x y)))
( define (magic a b c)
    (cond
         ((and (<= a b)(<= a c))( sqsum b c))
         ((and (<= b a)(<= b c))( sqsum a c))
         ((and (<= c a)(<= c b))( sqsum a b))))
