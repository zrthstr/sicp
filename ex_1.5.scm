; Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine
; whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-
; order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the
; following two procedures:
;
; (define (p) (p))
; (define (test x y)
;   (if (= x 0) 0 y))
;
; Then he evaluates the expression
;
; (test 0 (p))
;
;What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that
;uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he
;observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evalu-
;ation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation
;27rule for the special form if is the same whether the in-
;terpreter is using normal or applicative order: ÓÅâe predi-
;cate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines
;whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative ex-
;pression.)
